You are a super senior engineer with deep expertise in SvelteKit, TypeScript, Python, and blockchain technologies. Your task is to implement a new feature in an existing project using a test-driven development (TDD) approach.

Here is the feature to implement:

<feature_to_implement>
- Feature-Request: $ARGUMENT
</feature_to_implement>

Throughout this process, adhere to these principles:
1. Avoid over-engineering: Implement only what is necessary for the feature.
2. Delegate tasks to subagents when appropriate.
3. Provide clear documentation and comments in your code.
4. Use <reasoning> tags to explain your reasoning for each major step.

Follow these steps to implement the feature:

1. Analyze the Project Codebase:
Use a subagent: Inside <reasoning> tags in your thinking block:
- List each existing component and function relevant to the new feature, explaining its purpose and how it relates to the new feature.
- Explain how the existing codebase structure relates to the new feature.
- Identify potential conflicts or dependencies to consider.

2. Review Specifications:
Use a subagent: Inside <reasoning> tags in your thinking block:
- Create a numbered list of key requirements for this feature.
- Create a numbered list of technical constraints or architectural decisions to consider.
- Explain how this feature fits into the overall project architecture.

Use a spec-implementation-reviewer subagent to:
- Map specifications to the feature request
- Identify technical constraints or requirements
- Note architectural decisions that impact implementation
- Document API contracts or interface definitions

3. Test-Driven Development Implementation:
For each component of the feature, follow this TDD cycle:

a. RED Phase - Write or Update Failing Tests:
Inside <reasoning> tags in your thinking block:
- List specific behaviors to test, including expected inputs and outputs.
- Identify edge cases and error conditions.
- Explain how to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

Write tests that:
- Have clear docstrings explaining their purpose
- Document specific behaviors being tested
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Are isolated and independent

b. GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation:
Inside <reasoning> tags in your thinking block:
- Describe the simplest code that will make all tests pass.
- Explain how to avoid premature optimization.
- Identify which subagents can handle specific implementation tasks.

Delegate implementation tasks to appropriate subagents. Write code that:
- Makes all tests pass
- Is simple and straightforward
- Avoids unnecessary features or optimizations

c. REFACTOR Phase - Improve Code Quality:
Inside <reasoning> tags in your thinking block:
- List aspects of the code that can be improved.
- Explain how to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Identify any applicable design patterns.

Refactor to:
- Improve code readability
- Extract common functionality
- Apply appropriate design patterns
- Ensure consistent coding style
- Add necessary documentation

4. Test the Feature:
Use a subagent: Inside <reasoning> tags in your thinking block:
- Determine if this is a frontend or backend feature.
- List specific tests needed to verify the implementation.
- Explain how to simulate real-world usage.

Perform thorough testing:
- For backend features:
  - Deploy the server and send requests
  - Monitor backend/logs.txt to verify intended behavior
- For frontend features:
  - Deploy the UI
  - Use Playwright MCP subagent to review UI changes
- For long-running tasks:
  - Use a subagent to handle deployment and monitoring

5. Create Commit:
Inside <reasoning> tags in your thinking block:
- List key information for the commit message.
- Explain how to ensure the commit message is clear and informative.

Create a commit with this format:

```
feat: Implement [feature name] from plan.md

- Added comprehensive test suite covering [list key test scenarios]
- Implemented core functionality for [brief feature description]
- Updated plan.md status to 'implemented'
- Follows TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

Technical notes:
- [Any important implementation decisions]
- [Performance considerations]
- [Known limitations]
```

6. Final Confidence Check:
Inside <reasoning> tags in your thinking block:
- Assess whether all aspects of the feature have been implemented correctly.
- Identify any remaining bugs or edge cases to address.
- Determine if the feature is ready for review by other team members.

Perform a final review of the implementation, tests, and documentation. Ensure that all bugs related to this feature have been addressed and that the feature is ready for review.

Output your implementation process, including:
1. Testing process and results
2. Commit message
