# Quorum AI

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This application currently only supports Base network due to the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) integration being locked to Base. All voting attestations will be recorded on Base, regardless of which network the DAO operates on.**

A sophisticated autonomous voting agent for DAO governance on the Olas Pearl platform. This full-stack application enables automated participation in decentralized governance through AI-powered proposal analysis and voting decisions, featuring integration with Snapshot and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash.

## Required Contracts

Before running Quorum AI, you need access to the following smart contracts:

### üìã Required Deployments

1. **EAS Schema** - Register attestation schema on Base network
   - Schema: `address agent, string spaceId, string proposalId, uint8 voteChoice, string snapshotSig, uint256 timestamp, string runId, uint8 confidence`
   - Deploy via [EAS Schema Registry](https://base.easscan.org/schema/create)
   - Save the Schema UID for environment configuration

2. **AttestationTracker** - EAS wrapper contract for vote attestations
   - Location: `contracts/src/AttestationTracker.sol`
   - Deploy using: `forge script script/Deploy.s.sol`
   - Required for on-chain vote tracking

3. **QuorumStaking** *(Optional)* - Token activity monitoring
   - Location: `contracts/src/QuorumStaking.sol`
   - Deploy using: `forge script script/DeployQuorumStaking.s.sol`
   - Required only if using activity-based rewards

### üîë Key Considerations

- **Network**: Base mainnet/testnet recommended for lower gas costs
- **Dependencies**: AttestationTracker requires EAS contract address
- **Order**: Deploy EAS Schema ‚Üí AttestationTracker ‚Üí QuorumStaking
- **Environment**: Update `.env` with all deployed contract addresses
- **Security**: Use dedicated deployment wallet with sufficient ETH

## Environment Variables

Quorum AI requires several environment variables for proper operation. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

### üîë Required Variables

# EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) configuration
EAS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021  # Base mainnet
EAS_SCHEMA_UID=0x...  # 32-byte hex string from EAS schema deployment

# AttestationTracker contract (optional - if using wrapper contract)

```

**Network Configuration**
```bash
# Base network RPC (choose one)
BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
# OR

# Chain configuration
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org  # Primary RPC endpoint
CHAIN_ID=8453  # Base mainnet
```

**Wallet Configuration**
```bash
# Agent wallet configuration (choose one method)

# Method 1: Private key file (recommended for production)
# Create file: ethereum_private_key.txt with private key (without 0x prefix)
# File permissions must be 600 (owner read/write only)

# Method 2: Environment variable (for testing)
EOA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x_prefix

# Gnosis Safe configuration (for multi-sig voting)
BASE_SAFE_ADDRESS=0x...  # Your Safe address on Base network
SAFE_CONTRACT_ADDRESSES={"base": "0x..."}  # JSON string format
```
