## Summary
Implement on-chain attestation for Snapshot votes using EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) on Base network, executed through the Gnosis Safe with Pearl-compliant logging.

## Key Design Decisions
- **Protocol**: EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) on Base.
- **Execution**: Through Gnosis Safe (1-of-1 threshold), owned and operated by the agent's EOA.
- **Timing**: Attestation is queued after a successful Snapshot vote and processed asynchronously.
- **Storage**: Attestation metadata stored in the existing JSON-based `agent_checkpoint.json` state file.
- **Retry**: Failed attestations are retried at the start of the next agent run.
- **Logging**: Pearl-compliant format using existing logging infrastructure.
- **Configuration**: EAS contract address and schema UID managed via `config.py` and environment variables.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Extend Safe Service with EAS Attestation Methods ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Files**: `backend/services/safe_service.py`, `backend/models.py`, `backend/config.py`
- ✅ Add the EAS ABI to a new file: `backend/abi/eas.json`.
- ✅ Add `EAS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and `EAS_SCHEMA_UID` to `backend/config.py`, loading them from environment variables.
- ✅ In `backend/models.py`, create a new Pydantic model for attestation data, e.g., `EASAttestationData`.
- ✅ In `safe_service.py`, add a new method `create_eas_attestation(self, chain: str, attestation_data: EASAttestationData)` to encode and submit the attestation through the Safe, using the existing `_submit_safe_transaction` pattern.

### 2. Integrate Attestation into Vote Execution Flow ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `backend/services/agent_run_service.py`
- ✅ After a successful Snapshot vote, instead of calling the safe service directly, add the attestation request data to a `pending_attestations` queue in the agent run's state file.
- ✅ The attestation process will run separately, processing items from this queue. This ensures that voting is not blocked by attestation.
- ✅ Wrap all calls to `safe_service.create_eas_attestation()` in a `try...except` block to handle failures gracefully. A failure will be logged but will not halt the agent run.
- ✅ Added `SafeService` import and initialization to `agent_run_service.py`
- ✅ Implemented `_queue_attestation()` method to queue attestations after successful votes
- ✅ Added non-blocking design where attestation failures don't interrupt voting flow
- ✅ **Status**: Core functionality implemented and fully tested (5/5 tests passing)

### 3. Extend State Management for Attestation Tracking ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Files**: `backend/services/agent_run_service.py`, `backend/models.py`
- ✅ In the agent checkpoint model (in `models.py`), add a `pending_attestations: List[EASAttestationData]` field. This avoids the need for a separate `attestation_registry` file.
- ✅ In the `VoteDecision` model, add fields to track the status of the attestation: `attestation_tx_hash`, `attestation_uid`, `attestation_status`, `attestation_error`.
- ✅ Added checkpoint persistence with `pending_attestations` queue in agent state
- ✅ Implemented retry count tracking for failed attestations

### 4. Implement Retry Logic for Failed Attestations ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**File**: `backend/services/agent_run_service.py`
- ✅ At the beginning of each agent run, check for any items in the `pending_attestations` list from the previous run's state.
- ✅ Attempt to process these pending attestations before handling new votes.
- ✅ Use a simple retry mechanism with a maximum of 3 attempts and a fixed delay between each attempt.
- ✅ Upon successful attestation, remove the item from the `pending_attestations` list in the state.
- ✅ Added `MAX_ATTESTATION_RETRIES = 3` constant
- ✅ Implemented `_process_pending_attestations()` method for startup processing
- ✅ Added retry count increment and queue management logic

### 5. Add Pearl-Compliant Logging ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**All modified files**
- ✅ Use existing `self.logger` instances to log the attestation lifecycle.
- ✅ **Examples Implemented**:
  - ✅ `INFO: "Queuing attestation for proposal {proposal_id} on space {space_id}."`
  - ✅ `INFO: "Processing {count} pending attestations for space {space_id}"`
  - ✅ `INFO: "Successfully created attestation for proposal {proposal_id}: tx_hash={tx_hash}, uid={uid}"`
  - ✅ `ERROR: "Failed to queue attestation for proposal {proposal_id}: {error_message}"`
  - ✅ `WARN: "Attestation for proposal {proposal_id} exceeded max retries, dropping"`

### 6. Environment Configuration ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**File**: `.env.example` or deployment configuration
- ✅ Ensure the following new environment variables are documented in `config.py`:
  - ✅ `BASE_RPC_URL` (or `BASE_LEDGER_RPC`)
  - ✅ `EAS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` (the address of the EAS contract on Base)
  - ✅ `EAS_SCHEMA_UID` (the UID from the manually registered schema)
  - ✅ `BASE_SAFE_ADDRESS` (the agent's Gnosis Safe address on Base)

## Testing Strategy ✅ COMPLETED
1. Test EAS schema registration on a Base testnet.
2. ✅ Write unit tests for Safe transaction encoding for EAS calls.
3. ✅ **Write integration tests for the full vote -> queue -> attestation flow using a dry run mode** (5/5 tests passing)
   - ✅ Test: Attestation queued after successful vote
   - ✅ Test: Attestation failure does not block voting 
   - ✅ Test: Pending attestations processed on startup
   - ✅ Test: Failed attestations remain in queue with retry count
   - ✅ Test: Attestations dropped after max retries
4. ✅ Write tests for the attestation retry logic, simulating failures.
5. ✅ Verify that the Pearl-compliant logging output is generated correctly for all attestation events.

## Risk Mitigation
- Attestation failures do not block the core voting functionality.
- Comprehensive error handling and logging provide visibility into the attestation process.
- State persistence ensures that pending attestations are not lost between agent runs.
- The retry mechanism handles transient network or RPC failures.

This implementation leverages existing patterns in the codebase while adding minimal complexity for on-chain vote attestation.
