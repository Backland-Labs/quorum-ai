# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Validate and set up the test environment for Quorum AI's autonomous voting agent according to the test plan requirements. The environment includes local Anvil blockchain, Docker services, external API integrations, and contract deployments.

## Environment Setup Validation

### Task 1.1: Verify Anvil Blockchain Service
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Anvil is running on port 8545 with Base chain ID 8453
  * RPC endpoint responds to basic queries
  * Forked from Base mainnet successfully
- Test Cases:
  * Test that `cast chain-id --rpc-url http://localhost:8545` returns 8453
- Integration Points:
  * Local blockchain service for contract deployment and testing
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * No files need modification (service already running)

### Task 1.2: Validate Environment Variables
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * All required environment variables are present in .env file
  * OpenRouter API key is configured
  * Snapshot GraphQL endpoint is set to testnet
  * Local RPC and chain configuration matches Anvil setup
- Test Cases:
  * Test that .env file contains all required variables from test plan
- Integration Points:
  * Environment configuration for Docker services
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * /Users/max/code/quorum-ai/.env (already validated and updated)

### Task 1.3: Deploy EAS Contracts
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * AttestationTracker contract deployed to local Anvil
  * Contract address updated in .env file
  * Contract ownership properly configured
  * EAS integration address set correctly
- Test Cases:
  * Test that deployed contract code exists at the specified address
- Integration Points:
  * Smart contract deployment on local blockchain
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * /Users/max/code/quorum-ai/contracts/deploy_local.sh (updated)
  * /Users/max/code/quorum-ai/.env (updated with contract address)

### Task 1.4: Initialize Test Data Structure
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Test-data directory structure created as specified
  * Initial state files created with default values
  * Deployment information documented
  * Log directories prepared for Pearl compliance
- Test Cases:
  * Test that all required directories and files exist
- Integration Points:
  * File system structure for state persistence
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * /Users/max/code/quorum-ai/test-data/state/agent_state.json (created)
  * /Users/max/code/quorum-ai/test-data/state/user_preferences.json (created)
  * /Users/max/code/quorum-ai/test-data/deployment.json (created)

### Task 1.5: Verify Docker Compose Configuration
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * Docker Compose file exists with backend and frontend services
  * Health check endpoints configured
  * Environment file properly referenced
  * Port mappings match test plan requirements
- Test Cases:
  * Test that docker-compose.yml contains required service definitions
- Integration Points:
  * Container orchestration configuration
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * /Users/max/code/quorum-ai/docker-compose.yml (exists, no modification needed)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Anvil blockchain running on port 8545 with chain ID 8453
- [x] OpenRouter API key configured in .env file
- [x] AttestationTracker contract deployed at 0x7e2ca159fb4ebb716ec14246d29ca1078ede9bfa
- [x] Test data directory structure created
- [x] All required environment variables set
- [x] Docker Compose configuration validated
- [ ] Docker services can be started (ready but not running)

## Current Status Summary

### Completed Setup Steps:
1. **Anvil Blockchain**: Running on port 8545 with correct Base chain ID (8453)
2. **Environment Variables**: All required variables configured in .env file
3. **Smart Contracts**: AttestationTracker deployed at 0x7e2ca159fb4ebb716ec14246d29ca1078ede9bfa
4. **Test Data Structure**: All directories and initial state files created
5. **API Keys**: OpenRouter API key configured

### Ready for Testing:
- Docker services can be started with `docker-compose up -d`
- Environment is fully configured for test execution
- All external service endpoints are configured (Snapshot testnet, OpenRouter)
- Local blockchain is ready for attestation testing

### Next Steps:
1. Start Docker services: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Verify health check endpoints respond correctly
3. Begin executing test scenarios from the test plan
4. Monitor agent runs and collect metrics
