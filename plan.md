# Implementation Plan: Refactor AI Service to Use Pydantic AI Agents

**GitHub Issue**: #145
**Branch**: `feature/pydantic-ai-agents-145`
**Status**: In Progress
**Task 1 Completed**: 2025-08-01

## Overview

Refactor the current AI service architecture from manual prompt/response handling to a structured Pydantic AI Agent system with tools, dependency injection, and file-based output workflows. This refactoring will improve code maintainability, testing coverage, and enable more sophisticated autonomous voting capabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Current Architecture Analysis

**Existing Implementation** (`backend/services/ai_service.py`):
- Manual prompt building in `_build_vote_decision_prompt()`
- Direct OpenRouter/Gemini 2.0 Flash integration via Pydantic AI
- Manual response parsing in `AIResponseProcessor` class
- Three voting strategies: conservative, balanced, aggressive
- Integration with `AgentRunService` for autonomous workflow
- Pearl-compliant logging with structured spans
- Returns `VoteDecision` objects with confidence scores and reasoning

**Integration Points**:
- Called by `AgentRunService.execute_agent_run()` for autonomous voting
- Uses `SnapshotService` for proposal data via REST API calls
- Supports both summarization and voting decision modes
- Existing test coverage >90% across multiple test files

## Target Architecture

**New Pydantic AI Agent System**:
1. **`VotingAgent`** class using `pydantic_ai.Agent`
2. **`VotingDependencies`** dataclass for dependency injection
3. **Agent Tools** for Snapshot API interactions:
   - `query_active_proposals` - Fetch proposals by space/status
   - `get_proposal_details` - Get detailed proposal content
   - `get_voting_power` - Calculate user voting power
4. **Structured Output** using existing `AiVoteResponse` model
5. **File-based Decision Workflow** for integration with external systems
6. **Dynamic System Prompts** based on user preferences and strategies
