# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement missing healthcheck endpoint fields for Olas Pearl compliance using a simplified MVP approach. The current `/healthcheck` endpoint returns basic state transition information but is missing several required fields: `is_tm_healthy`, `agent_health` object with 3 sub-fields, `rounds` array, and `rounds_info` object. This enhancement will ensure Pearl platform integration compliance while following the codebase's functional programming patterns and existing service architecture.

## Feature 1: Transaction Manager Health Tracking ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### Task 1.1: Implement Transaction Manager Health Function ✅ COMPLETED
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * ✅ Create `get_tm_health_status()` function in `backend/main.py` following functional programming pattern
  * ✅ Function returns boolean indicating transaction manager health based on SafeService connectivity
  * ✅ Uses `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` with TTL pattern for 30-second caching
  * ✅ Implements Pearl-compliant logging with `setup_pearl_logger`
  * ✅ Uses structured error handling with `ExternalServiceError` and safe fallback (returns False on error)
- Test Cases:
  * ✅ Test transaction manager health determination with SafeService connectivity check
- Integration Points:
  * ✅ Uses existing `SafeService` for connectivity validation
  * ✅ Integrates with existing dependency injection pattern from lifespan function
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * ✅ Modify `backend/main.py`

## Feature 2: Agent Health Object Implementation ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### Task 2.1: Create Agent Health Functions ✅ COMPLETED
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * ✅ Create `get_agent_health()` function returning object with 3 boolean fields
  * ✅ Implement `is_making_on_chain_transactions()` checking last 24 hours using VotingService
  * ✅ Implement `is_staking_kpi_met()` based on minimum daily transaction requirement
  * ✅ Implement `has_required_funds()` using SafeService balance check
  * ✅ All functions use `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` for performance (<100ms requirement)
  * ✅ Pearl-compliant logging for all health checks
  * ✅ Safe fallback values (False) for all fields on service errors
- Test Cases:
  * ✅ Test agent health object creation with all 3 boolean fields
- Integration Points:
  * ✅ Uses existing `VotingService` for transaction history
  * ✅ Uses existing `SafeService` for balance and transaction checks
  * ✅ Leverages existing `StateManager` for any required state caching
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * ✅ Modify `backend/main.py`

## Feature 3: Rounds Information Implementation ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### Task 3.1: Create Rounds Data Models ✅ COMPLETED
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * ✅ Create `RoundInfo` Pydantic model with minimal fields (id, timestamp, status)
  * ✅ Create `RoundsInfo` Pydantic model for metadata (total_rounds, last_round_timestamp)
  * ✅ Create `AgentHealthMetrics` model containing agent_health object structure
  * ✅ Create `HealthCheckResponse` model extending existing response with new fields
  * ✅ Models follow existing Pydantic patterns in codebase
- Test Cases:
  * ✅ Test Pydantic model validation and serialization for all new models
- Integration Points:
  * ✅ Extends existing healthcheck response structure
  * ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing fields
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * ✅ Modify `backend/models.py`

#### Task 3.2: Implement Rounds Tracking Functions ✅ COMPLETED
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * ✅ Create `get_recent_rounds()` function returning last 5-10 rounds from AgentRunService
  * ✅ Create `get_rounds_info()` function providing simple metadata
  * ✅ Use `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` for caching with 60-second TTL
  * ✅ Integrate with existing `StateTransitionTracker` pattern for round information
  * ✅ Pearl-compliant logging for rounds tracking
  * ✅ Safe fallback to empty arrays/objects on service errors
- Test Cases:
  * ✅ Test rounds tracking with AgentRunService integration
- Integration Points:
  * ✅ Uses existing `AgentRunService` for execution history
  * ✅ Extends existing `StateTransitionTracker` pattern
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * ✅ Modify `backend/main.py`

## Feature 4: Healthcheck Endpoint Enhancement ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### Task 4.1: Update Healthcheck Endpoint Function ✅ COMPLETED
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * ✅ Modify existing `healthcheck()` function in `backend/main.py`
  * ✅ Use `asyncio.gather()` for parallel service calls to meet <100ms requirement
  * ✅ Add all new fields while maintaining existing fields for backward compatibility
  * ✅ Implement comprehensive error handling with structured fallbacks
  * ✅ Use Pearl-compliant logging throughout
  * ✅ Return `HealthCheckResponse` model with all required and existing fields
- Test Cases:
  * ✅ Test complete healthcheck response includes all new and existing fields
- Integration Points:
  * ✅ Maintains existing integration with `StateTransitionTracker`
  * ✅ Uses all new health functions created in previous tasks
  * ✅ Follows existing dependency injection pattern
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * ✅ Modify `backend/main.py`

## Feature 5: Testing and Validation ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### Task 5.1: Update Existing Healthcheck Tests ✅ COMPLETED
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * ✅ Modify `test_healthcheck_endpoint.py` to validate all new fields
  * ✅ Ensure >90% test coverage requirement is met
  * ✅ Add performance tests validating <100ms response time
  * ✅ Test backward compatibility - all existing fields remain unchanged
  * ✅ Add error scenario tests with service failures
  * ✅ Mock external service calls following existing testing patterns
- Test Cases:
  * ✅ Test healthcheck endpoint returns all required Pearl fields with correct types
- Integration Points:
  * ✅ Updates existing test suite patterns
  * ✅ Uses existing test fixtures and mocking patterns
- Files to Modify/Create:
  * ✅ Modify `backend/tests/test_healthcheck_endpoint.py`

#### Task 5.2: Add Health Function Unit Tests ✅ COMPLETED
- Acceptance Criteria:
  * ✅ Create unit tests for all new health functions
  * ✅ Test caching behavior and TTL functionality
  * ✅ Test error handling and fallback scenarios
  * ✅ Achieve >90% coverage for all new code
  * ✅ Follow existing testing patterns from `specs/testing.md`
  * ✅ Use pytest-asyncio for async function testing
- Test Cases:
  * ✅ Test individual health functions with various service states and error conditions
- Integration Points:
  * ✅ Uses existing test configuration and fixtures
  * ✅ Follows established mocking patterns for external services
