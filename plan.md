# Logging Refactoring Plan: Migration from Logfire to Pearl-Compliant Logging

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to refactor the current Logfire-based logging system to meet the Pearl platform's technical specification. The goal is to remove the external Logfire dependency entirely and implement a Pearl-compliant logging system using Python's standard library.

## Current State Analysis

### Logfire Integration Scope
- **10 backend files** currently use Logfire for logging and tracing
- **Extensive span usage** for distributed tracing across operations
- **Structured logging** with key-value pairs throughout the application
- **Custom AgentRunLogger** service for specialized agent workflow logging
- **Test integration** with Logfire mocking in test suites
- **Configuration dependencies** in environment variables and settings

### Key Dependencies to Remove
- `logfire>=2.4.0` from `pyproject.toml`
- Environment variables: `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`, `LOGFIRE_PROJECT`, `LOGFIRE_IGNORE_NO_CONFIG`
- Configuration settings in `config.py`: `logfire_token`, `logfire_project`, `logfire_ignore_no_config`

## Pearl Specification Requirements

### Required Output Format
```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,mmm] [LOG_LEVEL] [agent] Your message
```

### Required Implementation Constraints
- **File Output**: Must write to `log.txt` in working directory
- **Standard Library Only**: No external logging dependencies
- **Log Levels**: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE
