# Authentication Specification

## Overview

This document defines the authentication and authorization patterns for the Quorum AI agent system. The application uses a hybrid approach combining blockchain authentication (for voting operations) and API key authentication (for external services).

## Authentication Architecture

### Current Implementation

The Quorum AI agent operates as an autonomous system with:

1. **No User Authentication**: The agent runs autonomously without user login
2. **Blockchain Authentication**: Ethereum private key for transaction signing
3. **API Key Authentication**: Service-level authentication for external APIs
4. **Agent-Based Design**: Designed for Olas Pearl App store deployment
