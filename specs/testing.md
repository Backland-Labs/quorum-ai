# Testing Specification

## Overview

This document defines the testing standards, practices, and requirements for the Quorum AI application. All developers must follow these guidelines to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementation when possible
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Target >90% code coverage
3. **Fast Feedback**: Tests should run quickly for rapid iteration
4. **Isolation**: Tests should be independent and deterministic
5. **Meaningful Assertions**: Test behavior, not implementation details
